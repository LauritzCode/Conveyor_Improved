# Conveyor Belt Exercise

This is a small C program that simulates whether a conveyor belt system can carry a given package load.  
The program takes two inputs: the number of motors and the weight of the packages.  
It then calculates the weight capacity of the conveyor belt and checks if the packages can be transported safely.
